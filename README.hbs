# Description

Provides utility class and methods for boilerplate projects to create/copy/remove files, directories and data files (json/yaml).
Created files, directories and data files are tracked and recorded to a json file, and modifications done by this library can be undone
by `reset()` method.

Please note that, this module does not try to be a version conrol system. Main purpose of this module is to modify and reverse selected files only.

# Synopsis

Written using TypeScript

```js
const ResettableFile = require("resettable-file");
const resettableFile = new ResettableFile("./registry.json", { logLevel: "info" }); // Set "warn" (default) or "error" for less noise

const packageData = resettableFile.getDataObjectSync("./package.1.json");       // Track changes by key/value level
packageData.set("scripts.myscript", "some-cmd").set("scripts.ls", "ls -al");    // Modify package.json
resettableFile.writeFileSync("some.txt", "Some text data here");                // Write data to file
resettableFile.createSymLinkSync("/some/where/tsconfig.json", "tsconfig.json"); // Create a symbolic link
resettableFile.createDirSync("some/deep/path");                                 // Creates directory tree
resettableFile.saveSync();                                                      // Save changes to registry
```

```js
// Delete created keys in package.json, delete file and symbolic link if not changed
// and delete directory tree if they are empty:
resettableFile.resetSync();
```

# Reset

**Can**

* Delete created files by this library if they are not changed outside.
* Delete created symbolic links if they are not changed outside.
* Delete created directories,
  * if they are empty
  * or all files in directories are created by this libray and they are not changed outside.
* Reset key/value pairs in data files (modifictions made by this library)
  * Delete created keys,
  * Create old keys and values for deleted keys,
  * Write old values to replaced keys,
  * Delete created values from arrays
  * Insert deleted values in to arrays (closest index possible)

**Can't**

* Create deleted files.
* Create deleted directories.
* Replace old content of files (except data files)
* Recreate deleted directories
* Recreate deleted symbolic links

As seen from what can and can't be done, `ResettableFile` is a utility to create and modify text based files and data files (json and yaml) and
not a backup/version control for deleted files.
